CI configuration calls all DrevOps ahoy commands directly from `config.yml` file.

You may add custom scripts, which would run only in CI, to this directory and 
reference them from `config.yml` file.

`drevops-test.sh` and `drevops-test-deployment.sh` scripts are internal DrevOps
test scripts. They are automatically removed on DrevOps install/update.
